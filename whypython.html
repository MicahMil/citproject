<div class="whypythonbox">
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Simple.</b></em>&nbsp; Python is simple programming language.  Its syntax feels more natual than other programming
programming languages. It reads like English, which takes away some of the stress of learning the syntax. It focuses more on the concepts of programming.</p> 
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Not Strict.</b></em>&nbsp; Python is not as strict as other programming languages. You are not required to define 
the type of variable in Python or add a semicolon at the end of a statement. It makes you follow good programming practice such as proper
indentation. Small things like this can make learning easier for beginners.</p>
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Expressive.</b></em>&nbsp; Python provides us with a countless number of constructs that help us focus on the solution rather
 than on the syntax. This is one of the outstanding python features that tells you why you should learn Python.</p>

<div class="whypythonbox">
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Lack of Mobile Support.</b></em>&nbsp; Python is seen as a weak language when it comes to mobile computing.
 It has been stagnate while other languages have excelled in this area. For this reason, Python is not a good option for mobile development. </p>
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Slower Programs.</b></em>&nbsp; Since Python is an interpreted language, the code has to be converted into machine language
at runtime which makes for a slower program.</p>
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Runtime Errors. </b></em>&nbsp; Python programmers cited several issues with the design of the language. Because the language 
is dynamically typed, it requires more testing and has errors that only show up at runtime. </p>
