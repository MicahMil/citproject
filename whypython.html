<u><p class="why">Why would you choose Python?</p></u>


<div class="whypythonbox">
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Simple.</b></em>&nbsp; Python is simple programming language.  Its syntax feels more natual than other programming
programming languages. Becuase it's a high level programming langugae, it reads like English 
which takes away some of the stress of learning the syntax. It takes away some of the worry 
about the details of programming and lets them focus more on the concepts of programming.</p> 

<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Not Strict.</b></em>&nbsp; Python is not as strict as other programming languages. For example, it's not nesecerry 
to define the type of variable in Python, and its also not necessary to add a semicolon at 
the end of a statement.  Python makes you follow good programming practice such as proper
indentation.  Small things like this can make learning easier for beginners.</p>

<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple">It's Expressive.</b></em>&nbsp; Python enables you to write programs with few lines of code.</p>

<u><p class="why">Why would you not choose Python?</p></u>

<div class="whypythonbox">
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Lack of Mobile Support.</b></em>&nbsp; There are some reasons why one might not choose Python for a project. One reason is the lack 
of mobile support that Python offers. It has been stagnate while other languages have excelled in this area. </p>
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Slower Programs.</b></em>&nbsp; Since Python is an interpreted language, the code has to be converted into machine language
at runtime which makes for a slower program.</p>
<p class="phistory"> <em><b class="simple"> Bad Habits. </b></em>&nbsp; Programmers who start by learning Python don't 
get some of the basic principles of other programming languages such as using brackets and semicolons.</p> </div>
