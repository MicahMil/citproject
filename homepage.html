	<h3> Welcome to Python</h3>
 <p><b>Here is a quick overview Python:</b></p>
<p class="homePageP">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for 
Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
<br>
<br>
The most well known aspect of Python is the ease of its use.  It does not rely on strict syntax like most other languages
do.  You also write less code in Python that you do in other languages.  For example, the code to write 'Hello World' in C++ is:
<br>
<br>
<em class="pythonCode">#include iostream<br>
int main()<br>
 { <br>
 cout << “Hello, world! “; <br>
 } <br>
return (0); </em> 
<br>
<br> 
and the code to write 'Hello World' in Python is: 
<br>
<br>
<em class="pythonCode">print(“Hello, world!”)</em>
<br>
<br>
As you can see, there is less clutter and more understandable code with Python. Most of the time Python requires less code than
other languages, such as C++. That is one reason many programmers use Python.  It can also be used
alongside other programming languages such as C++, C#, and Java.  It can be the core of the program or it also be used as a 
supporting script.
