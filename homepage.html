	<p>Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language with <br>
	mixed dynamic semantics. It was influenced by ABC, which is a general-purpose<br>
	programming language.  Python is a fairly easy programming language to learn <br>
	because it focuses on readability with its code.  Its syntax allows programmers <br>
	to less code for a program than you would in other languages. Python is an <br>
	interpreted language which means that the written code is not translated into <br>
	computer readable format during runtime.  Most programming languages convert the<br>
	code into computer readable format at the runtime, this is known as scripting . </p>
