<h3 class="h3history"> History of Python </h3>
<p class="historyBox">Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language with 
	mixed dynamic semantics. It was influenced by ABC, which is a general-purpose
	programming language.  
	Python was created in the late 1980’s and was implemented in 1989. It was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. 
	Here brief summary of how Python came to be: 
	<blockquote>
		In December 1989, I was looking for a ‘hobby’ programming project 
		that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and 
		not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about 
		lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being 
		in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

	<h3 class="h3history"> Versions of Python </h3>
	<p class="versionBox">
<img src="pythontimeline.jpg" width="425" height="400" /> Python has been consistent about coming out with new versions every few years since Python began.
In June of 2018, Python released version 3.7 which is the newest version currently availible. They are presently working on version 3.8 which is set to
come out in November of 2019. By continuing their advancement in coming out with newer versions, Python increases their ever growing populartiy in the programming world. 
 Python is third amongst the most popular programming languages as of August, 2018.
