<h2 id="h2history"> History of Python </h2>
<p id="box1">Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language with 
	mixed dynamic semantics. It was influenced by ABC, which is a general-purpose
	programming language.  
	Python was created in the late 1980’s and was implemented in 1989. It was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. 
	The story behind how he wrote Python is quite interesting: 
	<blockquote>
		In December 1989, I was looking for a ‘hobby’ programming project 
		that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and 
		not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about 
		lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being 
		in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus). 
	</blockquote>
		Python is still a widely used programming 
	language to this day and has a wide variety of capabilities. </p>
