<h2> What can Python do? </h2>
<p class="powerOfPython">Python was made to be very easy to learn and use and, although still very capable, has a few limitations from such a design.  As such, it is easier to think in terms 
of what it can't do.  As Python is an interpreted language, it cannot be used to build operatings systems and other such programs that rely on functions  from lower-level machine languages.  
Nonetheless, Python remains quite capable and widely used within three major facets.
</p>
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p class="powerOfPython">Python has exploded into web development as the language of choice for framworks such as Django and Flask.  Other server-side code links to various pieces of Python code 
allowing for easier and faster design and development.

<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>Python is often used in conjunction with various data visualization libraries to better sort and represent data to others.  Moreover, Pyhton has been used to build many machine learning libraries 
and frameworks.  Tools such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow provide users with with built-in learning algorithms and the power to build your own.
</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>Scripts are small programs designed to automate simple tasks.  For example, if you are installing a new computer in the office, you might have a script that installs necessary programs and another 
that modifies various settings in the operating system. Python works perfectly for scripting and makes the creation of the small programs incredibly easy and efficient.
</p>
<h3>Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Python has been tried in various other industries, but it has never gained the traction it has in the three areas above.  Most professional development of desktop applications, including games, 
happens in purpose-built languages such as Java and C#.  Many still use Python in this regard as a hobby, and to learn more about the abilites of Python.
