Performed by Vincent 11/8 - 11/11

Created new css files: history, homepage, whatcanitdo, and whypython

Linked all html files to their personal .css

Changed opening h3 headers to h2 headers in files: history.html, homepage.html, and whatcanitdo.html
	//Felt too small to be page header
	//Also need h3 headers on whatcanitdo so that there could be sub-headers

In citproject.css
	Added appropriate code fo h2 headers
	Changed h1 image
		background-size: cover -> contained;       // It was clipping off the word 'Python' on my screen,  this should fix that
	Moved certain parts to files: history.css, homepage.css, whatcanitdo.css, and whypython.css
		//There was a ton of stuff in there that was specific to certain files
		//Scince these files didn't need each others stuff, I linked them each
		//To their own personal stylesheet as well
